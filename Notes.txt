Types of Tests
•Unit Test = Test one unit of test isolation
•Integration Test = How multiple test units work together
•Functional Test = Test a particular function of software, here you test the behavior

Test-Driven Development (TDD) vs Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
    •BDD
        -Very explicit
        -To work with others roles
        -Defines process for different groups to interact

Guides on which query I should use
    •Queries Accessible to Everyone: Reflect the experience of visual/mouse users, as well as assistive technologies
        -getByRole: Elements that I can identify on the page
        -getByLabelText/getByDisplayValue: For forms, something that screen readers have access to
        -getByPlaceholderText: For input elements
        -getByText: Display elements that aren't interactive
    •Semantic Queries
        -getByAltText: For images
        -getByTitle: Elements that have Title attribute associated with them
    •Test IDs
        -getByTestId: User cannot see them, screen readers can't access them, and only to be used if it is entirely necessary
